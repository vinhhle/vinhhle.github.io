Moin moin!

My name is Vinh, a master student of Quantitative Economics, majoring in statistics and econometrics, from Kiel University.

This personal blog is a small project to apply what Iâ€™ve learned from lectures, books, and online courses. I use Python (`pandas`) for data wrangling and R (`ggplot2`) for data visualization. 

When not studying or working, I enjoy reading, playing guitar, taking pictures, traveling, and playing badminton.
